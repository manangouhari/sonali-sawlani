### Sonali Sawlani
<br>
Hey, this is Sonali :)
<br>
I am Graduated Computer Science Engineer with high spirits who has currently started documenting the journey on instagram because someone said it right It's not about the destination, it's about the journey .
<br>
I am working as Software Developer in an august organisation on frontend framework: Angular and learning Flutter out of interest and exploring to find what fits right to my interest in this tech industry.
<br>
A few of my hobbies apart from tech industry includes sketching, traveling to get wind of new places and cultures.
